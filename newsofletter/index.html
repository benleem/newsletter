                                thermosphere. Yesterday, <a href="" style="font-weight: 600;">Virgin Galactic</a> founder Richard Branson <a href="">boarded</a> Virgin's VSS Unity, 
                                traveling faster than three times the speed of sound to reach the edge of space. Branson just 
                                became the first billionaire founder of a space company to go to space on his own spacecraft 
                                (meta). Next up is Jeff Bezos, who announced his own trip before Branson decided to out-space him. 
                                The former Amazon CEO plans to take off on a <strong>Blue Origin</strong> spaceplane on July 20, along with his 
                                brother and a mystery bidder who's dropping <a href="">$28M</a> to join them — or $2.5M per minute of ride time.

                                <strong>Spaghetti Apollo-gnese...</strong> Apart from fueling billionaires' egos, these trips are major endorsements 
                                for NASA-sponsored space tourism (think: restaurant bookings on the ISS). NASA is leaning on private 
                                companies to help commercialize space. In May last year, Elon's <strong>SpaceX</strong> became the first private company 
                                to send humans to space. In May, Virgin completed its first human spaceflight, a critical step before 
                                it flies space tourists — ETA: early 2022. While $250K tickets to space make headlines, tourism is still 
                                a tiny sliver of the space industry.

                                2020, double what they raised in 2018. Today "space customers" mainly consist of governments and 
                                companies paying to launch satellites, cargo, and astronauts into space. In the not-so-distant future, 
                                they could be commercial space tourists. In the more distant future, they could be space colonizers

                                Compared to 2020's tomato juice numbers, 2021 might look like champagne: TSA traveler volumes are back 
                                to <a href="">85%</a> of pre-pandemic levels, and Delta's expected to report a sales increase from last year 
                                (no shocker there). Domestic recreational travel is rebounding — Fourth of July flyers even surpassed 
                                2019 levels. But international and business travel, which brings in <a href="">75%</a> of airline profits, remains 
                                grounded. Bill Gates said that half of biz travel may never return.

                                and most of Goldman's. Despite a record first half for M&A activity, analysts <a href="">expect</a> that trading and 
                                loan revenue has slowed from last year.

                                Merchants will get paid in fiat (aka: regular) currency. Meanwhile, <strong>Circle</strong> — the firm that operates 
                                USD Coin — is <a href="">going public</a> via SPAC at a $4.5B valuation. While crypto mainstream-ification is

                                <strong>Feeling the pushback...</strong> Big business in the US. On Friday, President Biden <a href="">signed</a> an exec order to 
                                curb the dominance of companies in industries including shipping, agriculture, healthcare, and tech. 
                                The goal: promote competitive markets and limit corporate dominance in everything from railroads to 
                                prescription drugs. It's part of a broader effort to confront consolidation and perceived anti-competitive 
                                pricing in big industries — and it has big companies on edge.
